=title Nesting Vimpoint Presentations


This is a nested presentation

* It can have multiple slides

* And all the usual **Vimpoint** features

It's just another presentation

* You create it in the usual way

* And run it in the usual way

But if it was called
as a nested presentation

* When it's done...

* You are returned to the originating slide
